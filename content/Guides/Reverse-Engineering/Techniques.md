There are two basic techniques that you can employ when analyzing programs. The first being `static analysis` and the other being `dynamic analysis`.

+ **Static analysis** : examines a programâ€™s executable without running it, using **decompilers** and **disassemblers** to reveal its code structure, control flow, and embedded data.  
+ **Dynamic analysis** : executes the program in a controlled environment, leveraging **debuggers** and instrumentation tools to observe its runtime behavior, memory usage, and logic paths.
