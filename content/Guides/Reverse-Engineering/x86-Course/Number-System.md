+ A bit is the fundamental unit in computing, represented by an electrical state: on (1) or off (0).
+ The binary number system uses **base 2**, meaning each digit’s place value is twice the value of the position to its right.
+ Only two digits exist in binary: 0 and 1.
+ In contrast, the decimal system is **base 10**, using digits 0–9; for example, decimal 15 = (1 × 10) + (5 × 1).
+ The same value in binary is 1111 (1 × 2³ + 1 × 2² + 1 × 2¹ + 1 × 2⁰ = 15).
+ Binary simplifies computer and hardware design by matching the on/off nature of electronic circuits to its two-digit system.
+ Eight bits make one byte. Four bits form a nibble, which covers values 0–15.
+ Hexadecimal is **base 16**. Each digit’s place value is 16× the value of the position to its right.
+ Hex uses 16 symbols: 0–9 for values zero through nine, and A–F for values ten through fifteen.
+ Converting between bases uses the general formula:
where _b_ is the base (2 for binary, 10 for decimal, 16 for hex).
